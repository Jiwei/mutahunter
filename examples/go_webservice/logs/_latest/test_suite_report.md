### Identified Weaknesses in the Test Suite

1. **Lack of Boundary Testing for Negative Numbers:**
   - The mutation changed the condition from `number < 0` to `number <= 0`, but the test suite does not include a test case for zero.
   - **Improvement:** Add a test case to check the behavior when the input number is zero to ensure it is handled correctly.

2. **Insufficient Coverage for Edge Cases:**
   - The test suite does not cover the edge case where the input number is exactly zero, which allowed the mutant to survive.
   - **Improvement:** Include edge case tests for zero in all relevant endpoints, especially those dealing with numerical inputs.

### Potential Bugs Not Caught by the Test Suite

1. **Zero Handling in Numerical Operations:**
   - The mutation indicates that zero might not be handled correctly in some numerical operations, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.
   - **Potential Bug:** If zero is not properly validated, it could lead to unexpected behavior or incorrect responses in endpoints that perform mathematical operations.

By addressing these weaknesses, the test suite can be made more robust and capable of catching similar mutations in the future.
