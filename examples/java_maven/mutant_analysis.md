### Vulnerable Code Areas
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/BankAccount.java`  
**Location:** Lines 28, 36, 39, 66  
**Description:** The methods `deposit` and `withdraw` do not handle zero or negative amounts correctly. Specifically, the `withdraw` method ignores the overdraft limit if the withdrawal amount is less than the balance. Additionally, the `scheduleTransaction` method allows for scheduling transactions with zero days, which could lead to unintended immediate execution.

### Test Case Gaps
**File:** `src/test/java/com/example/BankAccountTest.java`  
**Location:** Test methods `testDeposit`, `testWithdraw`, and `testScheduleTransaction`  
**Reason:** Existing test cases do not account for edge cases such as zero or negative deposit/withdrawal amounts. The tests also fail to validate the behavior when overdraft limits are ignored or when scheduling transactions for zero days.

### Improvement Recommendations
**New Test Cases Needed:**
1. **Test Method:** `testDepositZeroOrNegativeAmount`
   - **Description:** Verify that depositing zero or negative amounts throws an `IllegalArgumentException`.
   
2. **Test Method:** `testWithdrawZeroOrNegativeAmount`
   - **Description:** Ensure that attempting to withdraw zero or negative amounts results in an `IllegalArgumentException`.

3. **Test Method:** `testWithdrawExceedingBalanceIgnoringOverdraft`
   - **Description:** Test the scenario where a withdrawal exceeds the balance but is within the overdraft limit to confirm proper handling.

4. **Test Method:** `testScheduleTransactionZeroDays`
   - **Description:** Validate that scheduling a transaction for zero days raises an `IllegalArgumentException`.

By addressing these gaps, the test suite will better cover critical edge cases, enhancing the robustness of the `BankAccount` class.
